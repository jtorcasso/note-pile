Steps

1. Download the compressed package files
2. Run Latex on the .ins file.
3. Copy the .cfg and .sty files and any files
   with a .fd ending into a new directory in
   your tex-inputs search path. 
4. Then run texhash?

Search Paths
------------

Search paths can be found with the following:

    $ kpsepath tex | tr : '/n'

An example might be:

    $ /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex

To install eurofont I put the install files
inside a directory called "eurofont" which I
created in the above parent directory.
